# Epic 6: Claude Website DOM Analysis & Playwright Scripting (Local)

**Goal:** Analyze the Claude (claude.ai) web UI's structure and user flow for submitting a new chat, then define the specific sequence of Playwright commands needed to automate this process within an already logged-in browser context. Follow the `@web_automation_research_protocol.mdc`.

* **E6.T1:** **Manual Workflow Analysis (Claude):**
    * Start the FastAPI server (which connects to browser contexts **via `app/playwright_handler.py` as defined in Epic 3**).
    * In the Playwright-controlled Claude window (`claude.ai`):
        * Manually navigate the state for starting a *new* chat. Observe the URL and UI elements.
        * Identify the primary text input area (likely a `div` with `contenteditable="true"` or similar).
        * Identify the submit/send button.
        * Paste text and submit. Observe how the page updates. How can submission success be reliably detected?
        * Observe the final URL after the first response appears â€“ this is the target URL to capture.
* **E6.T2:** **DOM Inspection & Selector Strategy:**
    * Use browser developer tools within the Playwright-controlled Claude window.
    * Identify reliable CSS selectors or XPath expressions for:
        * The main text input area.
        * The submit button.
        * Any necessary intermediate elements (e.g., clearing splash screens, specific chat frames).
        * An element/state indicating the page is ready for input.
        * An element/state indicating successful submission/response start.
    * Prioritize stable attributes (`data-testid`, `aria-label`, unique IDs) over potentially brittle class names.
* **E6.T3:** **Playwright Script Definition:** Define the sequence of Playwright actions. **This sequence will eventually be implemented as a function within `app/playwright_handler.py`** (e.g., `submit_prompt_claude(page: Page, prompt: str) -> str | None`). The function will perform:
    * **Step 1:** Locate the text input area.
    * **Step 2:** Fill the input area with the transcript text.
    * **Step 3:** Locate the submit button.
    * **Step 4:** Click the submit button.
    * **Step 5:** Implement a reliable wait strategy (e.g., `page.wait_for_url(...)` if URL changes predictably, `expect(locator).to_be_visible()` for response elements, waiting for submit button state change). *Avoid fixed timeouts.*
    * **Step 6:** After the wait confirms submission/response, get the current page URL (`page.url`).
* **E6.T4:** **Refinement & Alternatives:** Consider edge cases: modals, dynamic loading, selector changes. Document potential failure points.
* **E6.T5:** **Testing (Manual Script Execution):** Use a simple standalone Python script or interactive session. **Import relevant initialization/connection functions from `app/playwright_handler.py`** to get the Claude `page` object. Manually execute the defined Playwright steps, refining selectors and waits.
